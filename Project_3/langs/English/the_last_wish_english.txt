Later, is was said the man came from the north, from Ropers Gate. He came on foot, leading his laden horse by the briddle. It was late afternoon and the ropers', saddlers' and tanners' stalls were already closed, the street empty. It was hot but the man had a black coat thrown over his shoulders. He drew attention to himself.
He stopped in front of the Old Narakort Inn, stood there for a moment, listened to the hubbub of voices. As usual, at this hour, it was full of people.
The stranger did not enter the Old Narakort. He pulled his horse farther down the street to another tavern, a smaller one, called The Fox. Not enjoying the best of reputations, it was almost empty.
The inkeeper raised his head above a barrel of pickled cucumbers and measures the man with his gaze. The outsider, still in his coat, stood stiffly in front of the counter, motinoless and silent.
 - "What will it be?"
 - "Beer", said the stranger. His voice was unpleasant.
The innkeeper wiped his hands on his canvas apron and filled a chipped earthenware tankward.
